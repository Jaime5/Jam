Customers:
- employers/employees


An employer/employee has an ideal goal for candidates, and they have an idea of what resume
you fit with your qualifications.

It can work both ways, both to applying to the job or when the employer
checks on your qualifications.

Case story 1:

Pam is applying to jobs and has a resume. She doesn't know if her resume
is qualified to apply for the jobs she applied to and doesn't want to search
through a whole list to see.

Pam uses our website, to validate that her resume is suited to the jobs she's applying.
She can get a percentage of similarity for her job and search for the ones that match her highest.

Case story 2:

Pam can check how competitive she is in her field using her resume, and having
her resume compared to other developers.

Pam uses the number of years of her experience, type (entry-level), price range.


We're going to focus on CASE STORY 1.
